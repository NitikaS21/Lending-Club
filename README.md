## General Information
- Background
- Data analysis performed –
* Univariate
* Bivariate
* Segmented Univariate
Load accepted? 
* Default
* Not – default
Loan rejected? – Not considered
- Problem solution  - The aim is to find patterns that suggest a borrower's likelihood of defaulting can be used to refuse the loan, reduce the loan amount, or lend at a higher interest rate to help lending club make thoughtful decision for loan processing. 
- Dataset being Used - Loan.csv dataset is being used which was provided to us.

## Conclusions
- Small business with high interest rate are defaulting at 100%. LC should avoid doing this and do not give loans to small business.
- Small businesses and educational categories are defaulting highest at the DTI - high. At medium DTI, small business and renewable energy is defaulting the most.
- We discovered that persons with a medium yearly income are more likely to fail on their loans after doing a segmented univariate study. People with a median annual income are more likely to request for larger loans, which increases the risk of their defaulting. LC should put a halt to these loans.
- Small business loans with a large loan amount and renewable energy with a low loan amount must not be granted since more than 30% and 25% of them default, respectively.
